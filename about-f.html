	<p class="abt-ac">LiD Travel is a renowned star on the Indian hospitality horizon. We take this opportunity to introduce LiD Travel as a firm which has all the solutions to your queries related to tours and events.<br><br>

Our business policies are based on integrity and innovative business practices that help us set the benchmarks today that others choose to follow tomorrow. We are sure with our unflinching dedication and quality services.<br><br>

The goal of the company is to provide our clients with successful and stress free tours or various events, be it cultural, adventure or theme based and when we arrange it, we believe that every participant should feel like an exclusive invited guest!! We strongly believe that our customers have all the rights to get the best of comforts & convenience and that is why we continuously strive to ensure that each event or tour is exclusive and tailored to the minutest details, to meet the specific needs of our client and express the client’s own uniqueness and creativity.<br><br>

LiD Travel focuses on individually crafted holiday concepts that combine elements from the rich repertoire. We use our extensive knowledge and research to explore fresh concepts in travel and generate new and innovative ideas, which we develop to produce customized itineraries. We realise that the same cookie cutter plans don’t work for every individual or every group. Our tailor made packages are constructed with each client’s specific requirements in mind: their choice of destination, length of the tour, budget constraints and personal preferences. Every package we design is one of a kind, because every client is one of a kind.</p>

	<p class="abt-ad11">Why We?</p>
	<p class="abt-ad12">
		We believe that customers’ “perceived service quality”, trust, and customer satisfaction, that actually earns you the customer loyalty in the long run, and we take no short cuts, as it comes from years of dedication and uncompromising vision. We do not leave any stone unturned to deliver the ultimate quality, assured. We feel reliability, responsiveness, understanding the needs, and assurance, are the guiding force and the key factors, when it comes to “quality deliverance” and here, where we stand miles apart from the crowd. It is easy said than done. Do try us once and you will find it was worth a trial.
